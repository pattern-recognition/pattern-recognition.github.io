### What is machine learning?
Machine learning is about writing algorithms having some tunable parameters (typically an array of floating point values) that  can learn from data.

Machine learning can be considered a subfield of Artificial Intelligence since those algorithms make computers learn to behave more intelligently by somehow generalizing rather that just storing and retrieving data items like a database system would do.

### What is pattern recognition?
Pattern recognition is nearly synonymous with machine learning. This branch of artificial intelligence focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data. In many cases, these patterns are learned from labeled "training" data (supervised learning), but when no labeled data is available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns (unsupervised learning).
