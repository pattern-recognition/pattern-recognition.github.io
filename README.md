### What is Pattern recognition?
Pattern recognition is about writing programs having some tunable parameters (typically an array of floating point values) that that can learn from data.

Machine Learning can be considered a subfield of Artificial Intelligence since those algorithms can be seen as building blocks to make computers learn to behave more intelligently by somehow generalizing rather that just storing and retrieving data items like a database system would do.
